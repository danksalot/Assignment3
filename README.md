# Assignment 3
*This is where the text of the assignment will go.*

The solution is built in C++, and has these classes:

Person
* Contains FirstName, LastName, and DateOfBirth
* Has a method to Display Details
* Has a method to check validity
  * FirstName and LastName are less than 10 characters
  * DateOfBirth is exactly 10 characters

StringManipulator
* Has a method to return a lower-case version of the input string
* Has a method to return an upper-case version of the input string
  
The program asks for input, repeating a step if the input for that step is invalid.

After the input is complete the program displays the saved people once as they were entered, then again in all upper-case and all lower-case versions.

There are no comments in the solution, but functions are small and named descriptively.
